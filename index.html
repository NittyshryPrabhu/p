       <b style="color: red;">    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; "Mystry of Love or Want" </b> is a story of a boy and his beloved about how a boy feel her beloved love.
       In this a girl borrows a book from a boy and both of them start thinking that now they will stay together forever, which does not happen because later the boy comes to know that the girl belongs to a well-off family and after seeing her house and situation, the boy lets her go from his life. But from this story we learn that we can love anyone or you can say we can desire anyone.

            <h2>Scene 2</h2>
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; Now the girl's friend felt that the boy and the girl already knew each other. And she started spreading this rumour in the entire class.

                <br> On the other side, the boy's friends also reacted in the same way as the girl's friend and they also started spreading rumours in the entire class.
                 
                 <br>N.. - Hey brother, nothing is like what you people think.
                 <br>Shalu, Ruchi, Nitish, Raja:- Okay, don't tell us. What is going on? We all understand what is going on.
                  <br>R..- Hey friends, nothing is like what you people think.
                 <br>Kanchan, Khushi, Rani:- Okay, don't tell us. What is going on? We all understand what is going on.</p>

                   <p  >Now somewhere in the mind of the boy, those things started to seem true and he also started enjoying. When the school was over,
       
                     <br>Boy's friend Nitish:- Why did you take the book from me and give it to her? You did not make her your own.<br> N...Hey friend, it is not like what you people think.
                     
                     <br>Girl's friend: Yes, how did she give you the book so soon? <br>R..Hey friend, how do I know why she gave it?
                     
                     <br>Now everyday in the class, they would talk to each other about how she made him her friend.
                     
                     <br>By the way, among the boys (N..) and among the girls (R..), both of them were completely different from everyone and a little smarter than everyone.
                     
                    <br> N.. used to get a lot of love from the boys and girls and those talks used to make the boy very happy that "she is your girl".</p>
        

            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;   <h3 style="text-align: center;" >(The above story is obidans 6th) The above story is of class 6th.</h3>
            <h2>Scene 3</h2>
            <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIG2.ozAmc0fpclKF73x4F4qC&pid=ImgGn" height="300" width="300" style=" margin-left: 400px;"  alt="">
            <p  >

              <br>N.. felt that R.. has also started knowing him somewhere. Now the class 7th exam started.
               <br>N..'s friend: Do you know the answer of the question, friend?
              <br>N- No, I don't know. I don't have the book, print it.
              <br>N..'s friend: I don't have it, that's why I am asking you. I don't have it, what should I do?
               <br>N..'s friend: Ask R.
               <br>N.. I, from her, will she give it to me, no I won't ask.
               <br>N..'s friend: Ask her once, she gives it to you only.
              <br> N.. Okay, I will ask.
              <br>N.. - R.. give me a little book. I have to see this question.
              <br> Now the girl's friend started understanding that there is something between the two.
              <br> R.. tells N.. to give it quickly.
              <br> Now when R.. gave the book, the boy's friend also started commenting a lot. And would say and do things to some.
             <br> The boy became famous in the whole class and even in the school.
             </p>


            <h2>Scene 4</h2>
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;<img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIG2.z3qQ.VdSq8oCYno54bNp&pid=ImgGn" height="300" width="300"  alt="">
            <p  ><br>Then came the annual examination of 7th, 
              <br>one day R.. could not appear in the exam.
               <br>Then all R..'s friends said that 
               <br>Sir, is there a boy like R.. here whose writing is like R.. 
               <br>So R..'s copy was given to N.. 
               <br>and N.. had to make a copy. 
               <br>Here N..'s friend also started enjoying himself.
                <br>N.. was also very happy, seeing all this, N felt that R really likes N somewhere.
               <br>Then in class 8 also the same thing happened as happened in 7th.
               <br>Now we went to class 9th, there
               <br>N had a separate college and R had a separate school. Now the distance between them was too much and N was very shy, maybe he was missing R.
               <br> I don't know why N also felt that R must be missing N. <br>These two never met in 9th and 10th. 
               <br>Then once they met in class 11th, N was very surprised that how could this be possible.
               <br><i style="color: red;"> After 2 years they met again, N started feeling like it happens in movies that true love is always found. N felt the same way.</i></p>
      
 

            <h2>Scene 5</h2>
            <p >
                But in 11th and 12th, I never talked to either N from  R or R from N. Actually, there was no such opportunity to help each other. But this is a true story, it is a little difficult to fulfill one's desires and one who does so can endure a lot of pain. N and R never let their desires come out of their hearts. But R knew about N's wishes. But N was not aware of R's wishes. Friends, do you think it was desire or love or attraction. N never knew what this was?But if we look at it that way, that meeting is the beginning of this story. The first time she asks for a book from the R N. Would this story have been possible if R N had not asked for the book? No, not at all. Friend N feels that all this is just mental pain and this pain also reduces with time. So friends, when you are in love with someone, fulfill it and keep doing your duty at the same time.
